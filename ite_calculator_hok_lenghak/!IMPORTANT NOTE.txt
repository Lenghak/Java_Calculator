THE CALCULATOR DOES NOT SEEM TO SHOW THE VIEW DURING THE DEVELOPING PROCESS

*** This is the problem and the solution file ***
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

PATTERN : Each Calculator start up with the creation of buttons which use for each button layout. Each component class
        contains the specific component materials such as the STRING (text on the button), getters and setters associating
        with the controller class.

            The controller class consists of many kind of methods, most of which will is the methods for getting collecting
        the component and form them into one collection as a HashMap.

        !-- Each component class can be derived from Standard Component for better performance and reducing the
            redundancy
        --!

FIXME : The problem has occurred when using "static" buttons that made inside the final button class.
    The idea behind the creation of the class is the make lists of usable buttons for every accessory class to call and use
    However, after using the button with more calculator type involved, the button has duplicated but has the same references
    which cause the button to perform action multiple time per click.  //-> FIXED!


FIXME : The problem of the unpleasant UI on the IO view has occurred while trying to resize the text to smaller or
    larger size to fit the label size. The issues appear as the string has looping resize back and up when the gap between
    the smaller font size and the larger one trigger each other.


FIXME : The bug has been found while trying to use the calculation process.
    1. The parenthesis between two operators to prevent confusion. //-> DONE
    2. Multiple calculation of the standard IO      // -> DONE BY REDO

    /IDEA 1 : Don't use the static button and let the layout class create new buttons
    each time a new window of a calculator type appear       //-> WORKED
